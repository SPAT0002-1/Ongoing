    "Both the model fitting and model selection problems can be approached from either a *frequentist* or a *Bayesian* standpoint. The \"philosophical\" difference between the two approaches will not be discussed in details. The interested reader (ideally already familiar with Bayesian statistics) may read [Bayes_philosophy.ipynb](Bayes_philosophy.ipynb) and [J. VanderPlass blog posts](http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/03/11/frequentism-and-bayesianism-a-practical-intro/) to get more insights on this question. We propose to review the formalism of Bayes statistics in the next Section. \n"

    "- *Parameter Uncertainties*: Whether frequentist or Bayesian, the maximum likelihood \"point estimate\" is only a small part of the picture. What we're really interested in scientifically is the uncertainty of the estimates. So simply reporting a point estimate is not appropriate. In frequentist approaches, \"error bars\" are generally computed from *Confidence Intervals*, which effectively measure the probability that the data encompass the true (fixed) value of the parameter, hence $P(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}\\mid\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, rather than $P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}\\mid D)$, which is effectively what we are interested in (and what is derived from the Bayesian approach). Note the difference: the Bayesian solution is a statement of probability about the parameter value given fixed bounds. The frequentist solution is a probability about the bounds given a fixed parameter value. This follows directly from the philosophical definitions of probability that the two approaches are based on.\n",

    "\n",
    "- In Bayesian statistics, the problem setting can be framed: we want to infer some probability about reality (e.g. the mass of a planet) given some data and some information about it. Mathematically this is done by computing the posterior probability distribution $𝑃(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} | 𝐷,𝐼)$, where $\\theta$ are the parameters of the model used to question nature, $D$ are the data that we obtained, and $I$ encapsulates our knowledge on the (parameters of the) problem.\n",
    "- In the context of model fitting, the Bayes theorem is expressed: \n",

    "P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D\\mid \\boldsymbol{\\theta})P(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{P(D)}\n",

    "- The Bayesian approach differs from the Frequentist's one in several conceptual aspects. In practice, one of the main difference is that in the frequentist's framework we search for the *best* parameters of a model and derive some confidence intervals, which give a statement about the probability that a new measurement of a parameter falls in a given range. In a Bayesian framework, we derive the posterior probability distribution on a parameter (Which effectively is a non sense for a frequentist). One also defines **Credible Intervals**, which are intervals defined such that we have a given probability that parameters effectively fall in those intervals. This is conceptually quite different from the confidence interval defined in the Frequentist's framework.  "
