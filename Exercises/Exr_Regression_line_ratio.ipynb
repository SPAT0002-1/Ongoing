    "# Measuring line ratio and uncertainties from a spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "The file `data_spec_01.txt` contains the spectrum of an object with a continuum emission (that can be modeled as a straight line) and 2 emission lines (the [OIII] doublet): Line 1 at wavelength $\\lambda \\sim 4959 \\AA$, and line 2 at wavelength $\\lambda \\sim 5007 \\AA$. ($\\AA$ corresponds to Angströms)\n",
    "\n",
    "The file contains 3 columns: [0] Wavelength ($\\AA$), [1] Flux (arbitrary units), [2] $\\sigma_{\\rm flux}$ (i.e. uncertainty on the flux). \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is: \n",
    "- To model this spectrum with a model made of a sum of a continuum and 2 gaussian emission line profiles.\n",
    "- To discuss the quality of the fit. \n",
    "- To derive the ratio line2 / line1 (where line1 and line2 correpsond to the intensity of the 2 lines; i.e. peak not integrated flux) and the associated uncertainty on this ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A more realistic situation \n",
    "\n",
    "Same problem applied to the spectrum `data_spec_01_nosigma.txt`. This spectrum contains only 2 columns (no sigma information is provided). While you do not know the uncertainty for each wavelength, you know that the noise is Poissonian (i.e. follows a poisson distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "## One step beyond\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the uncertainty on the flux ratio between the *integrated line fluxes* (Do not forget covariances between parameters).   \n",
    "\n",
    "Tip: The following python commands may be useful: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "scipy.stats.multivariate_normal(args, allow_singular=True)\n",
    "np.trapz(x, y)   # for Trapezoidal integration\n",
    "```"
