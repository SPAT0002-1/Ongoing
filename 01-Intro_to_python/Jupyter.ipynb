    "Project Jupyter was born out of the IPython project. It started as Ipython notebook but evolved to be a multi-language notebook environment. The name Jupyter is an indirect acronym of the three core languages it was designed for: **JU**lia, **PYT**hon, and **R**. So it is not because of its \"planet's\" sounding (the acronym has been designed for this !) that I have picked it up for this class ... but because this is a very useful tool and handy way to use python. As it is a notebook, you keep track of everything you want which is an important feature for:     \n",

    "I think that Jupyter is very handy for number of daily work but not for everything. You may need, from time to time, to run python scripts (we'll see later how to do this) in non interactive mode. These would be scripts you have developped and that are e.g. quite demanding in memory, perform long and/or complex calculation, or maybe need to be run on a powerful machine (which is not your Desktop). Use of GUI (Graphical User Interface) is also recommended (in my opinion) to write your functions/packages and debug them. For this, there is IDE (Interactive Development environment) that provides you with editor, debuger, (i-)python consoles, command history consoles, help windows, \"variable\" properties consoles, ...  \n",

    "**Another reason** why knowing a bit jupyter is useful is that it becomes the entrance door to several big online science platforms. As introduced in this paper by Juneau et al. 2021 https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06527, the American Astronomical Society has developped jupyter interfaces to access their science ecosystems. This is the case e.g. of the [AtroDataLab](https://datalab.noirlab.edu/) and of the [DESIHUB](https://desihub.github.io/). Not all the platforms are public but this an illustration, among others, that Jupyter is being more and more popular for collaboration in the astronomical community.  "
