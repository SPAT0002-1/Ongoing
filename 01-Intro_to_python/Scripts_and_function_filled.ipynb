After discussing those two uses of programs, we will see how to assemble lines of codes to complete a specific task, namely how to write what one knows as `procedure` or `function` .  \n"

    "## Interactive python outside `Jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 main ways to run python interactively within a console or a terminal window. One can use the standard Python prompt, which can be launched by typing `python` in a terminal. Instead, one can use a feature enhanced prompt, `ipython`, where \"i\" stands for interactive (which also means that IPython is an *interpreter*). This is an add-on package that adds many features to the default Python shell, including the ability to edit and navigate the history of previous commands, as well as the ability to tab-complete variable and function names. You can also write several commands one after the other before executing them by typing `Ctrl Enter` between each command instead of `Enter`. For some versions of ipython, this is rather `Ctrl o`. `IPython` allows you also to use any shell command by preceding it with a `!` as we did at the beginning of this Notebook (If this does not work, try without the `!`). This is basically telling Ipython that this shell is activated in the *code* cells of this Jupyter Notebook.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have launched `ipython`, you can proceed as follows to type your `python` commands: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "x\n",
    "\n",
    "Out[1]: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use an `ipython` shell, you can access the command history by pressing up/down arrows. This feature doesn't work within jupyter.  "

    "\n",
    "While the interactive Python mode is very useful for exploring and trying out code, you will eventually want to write a script to record and reproduce what you did, or to do things that are too complex to type in interactively (defining functions, classes, etc.). To write a Python script, just use your favorite code editor to put the code in a file with a .py extension. For example, we can create a file called `test.py` containing:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "And then you can run it within a terminal by typing `python test.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** It is also possible to make Python scripts executable. Simply add `#!/usr/bin/env python` (or the path towards your `python` \"executable\") on the first line of your test.py script and change the file permission to make it executable with `chmod +x test.py`. Now the script can be run without the preceeding python command; instead you can just type `./test.py` in the command line. Note that this will only work on Linux and Macs, not on Windows.\n",

Instead, there are simple text editor available with every OS, or more advanced ones which recognise code syntax and provide enriched coloring of your code to help legibility. Even more advanced solutions exist withing what is called IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

    "## Functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen the first bricks of python coding, but once it is necessary to automate some task, it becomes convenient to define **functions**. A function is a kind of \"mini-script\" that can accept (optionally) one or several `arguments`. Here is how you define a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def moffat1D(r, I, alpha, beta):\n",
    "    arg = (r / alpha)**2 + 1\n",
    "    y = I / arg**(beta)\n",
    "    return y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns the value of a Moffat profile/function at position `r`:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$y = I_0  \\left( \\left ( \\frac{r}{\\alpha} \\right )^2 +1 \\right)^{-\\beta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This Moffat profile is characterized by the parameters `I`, a normalization factor, `alpha`, the width of the moffat, or rather a scale parameter, and `beta`, a parameter governing the shape of the profile. When $\\beta = 1$, the Moffat profile is identical to a Lorentz \"profile\".    \n",
    "\n",
    "The characteristics of functions are:\n",
    "- They start with the `def` keyword, followed by the function name\n",
    "- The argument of the function is in parentheses \n",
    "- After the parentheses, starts a colon `:` which marks the beginning of the code block corresponding to your operation. \n",
    "- The code block associated with the function is **indentated** w.r.t. the main text. This is a *very important* property the python language: indentation (with tabulation or 4-spaces -4-spaces are officially recommended by many python-friendly editors convert your tab into space within your code.) are part of the code, they help legibility BUT not only. They tell the code that something special is happening. \n",
    "- In the above code, a **local variable** (you won't have access to it outside your function) `arg` has been defined\n",
    "- The function ends when new code is NOT indented or when a `return` statement is encountered.\n",
    "- There are some rules regarding function arguments:\n",
    "    * First argument(s) of a function should be mandatory arguments, with no default value. \n",
    "    * Next argument(s) are optional arguments for which you give default values\n",
    "    * You cannot put an argument without default value *after* one with a default value. \n",
    "    * Arguments without default value are positional ones, so if you define `def f(a):`, you do no have to specify the keyword of the function when giving it a value. i.e. `f(0)` will evaluate the function at 0, but `f(a=0)` will also work. On the other hand `f(0, a=0)` will return an Error !\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "- `Python` has many built-in functions (some are called methods when they are defined in some objects-classes). For example, the function `range(5)` returns a sequential list of integers.\n",
    "- Python 3 disallows mixing the use of tabs and spaces for indentation. Python 2 code indented with a mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces exclusively. \n",
    "- When a final formal parameter of the form `**name` (often `**kwargs` is used) is present, it receives a dictionary containing all keyword arguments except for those corresponding to a formal parameter. This may be combined with a formal parameter of the form `*name` (`*args`) which receives a tuple containing the positional arguments beyond the formal parameter list. (`*name` must occur before `**name`.) You may have a look [here](https://pythontips.com/2013/08/04/args-and-kwargs-in-python-explained/) for more detailed explanations "

    "#### 1.6.1 Functions and docstrings \n",
    "\n",
    "A **very useful** functionality of python is the ability to write, together with your function a simple `help` / basic documentation. For this, you simply have to start the \"help\"-block with triple-quotes (i.e. `\"\"\"`) and end it similarly (this `help()` block needs to be indentated). In python jargon, this help block is effectively called a `Docstring`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `Docstring` can be called in interactive mode (`help(myfunction)`) will return the information present in that Doctring. *Within Jupyter notebooks*, you can use the combination of keys `Shift + Tab` when your cursor is positioned just after the opening parenthese, to see the help in a small *pop-up window* (repeat `Shift+Tab` for different options). Alternatively, just run the cell calling your function followed by a question mark: `myfunction?`\n",
    "\n",
    "Because `Docstrings` are used to design the `help`, it means that it is better to follow some rules when writing them. While those rules are not universal, a recommended and widely used format is the following (NumPy-style dcstrings, which is also compliant with Sphinx Documentation tool):\n",

    "- You can read the [Docstring convention](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) that lists recommendations in writing the help of your function. The one described above, the one used by the numpy programmers, is explained on the [numpydoc webapge](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#format) \n",
    "- In the \"programming\" section of this class, we *learn to drive* (code in python) but we won't spend too much time on the *traffic regulation* (i.e. how to code well following best practices). The [Style guide for Python code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is probably a good way to get recommendations on *good practices* for programming in `Python`. We'll try to get used to some of them (as above), but cannot afford spending too much time on this topic.\n",
    "- When publishing papers, you may be encouraged to also release your codes along with your scientific results, or may want to release a public code in the future. Reading the good practices linked above is therefore recommended before doing any serious programming. (See at the end of this notebook for a summary)"

    "Sometimes, when you look at a function definition in Python, you might see that it takes two strange arguments: `*args` and `**kwargs`. What is this ? `*args` and `**kwargs` allow you to pass multiple arguments or keyword arguments to a function. `*args` is a way to accept positional arguments to a function without defining them.     \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def line(x, a, b):\n",
    "    y = a * x + b \n",
    "    return y\n",

    "def line(x, *args):\n",
    "    a, b = args \n",
    "    y = a * x + b \n",

This also means that you can access arguments of a function using `*args` instead of explicitly listing your parameters but remember that order is crucial !  \n",
    "\n",
    "`**kwargs` works just like `*args`, but instead of accepting *positional arguments* it accepts *keyword* arguments. What is important here is the unpacking operator `**`. You can see it as unpacking twice the entries: first creating a tuple of names, second a tuple of values, and associating them by pairs. This is basically what does a dictionary, and the object created by the `**` operator is effectively a dictionary.\n",

This also means that if you have, for your function, an explicit definition of parameters, you can also access them using the `*` or `**` operators. \n",
