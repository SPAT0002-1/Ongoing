    "\n",
    "Is it Yet Another Language ? No, this is, in my opinion, the most important programming language you should master before the end of your cursus. Over the past (two) decade(s), `Python` has become one of the most popular/used language in data science in general, and in astronomy in particular. The reasons for this are rooted in several of the advantages of `Python`:\n",
    "- readability;\n",
    "- flexibility\n",
    "- high-level language;\n",
    "- robust methods for binding with `C`, `C++` and `Fortran` libraries (speed, legacy);\n",
    "- growing number of libraries (coordinated by a very active community) and modules dedicated to specific scientific problems;\n",
    "- \"one-fits-it-all\" scripting language for every task you may have to perform in astronomy;\n",
    "- Data reduction at a growing number of space observatories are now being done in Python. This is the case for ALMA ([CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) environment calls C/C++ programs within IPython), JWST (see [data reduction tools](https://jwst.stsci.edu/observing-programs/data-analysis-toolbox) developed in Python), `HST`, `Chandra` (there are `CIAO` modules for Python),... and many others. All the data reduction methods developed in the framework of IRAF are available through `pyraf`. The only noticable exception remains `ESO`'s data reduction tools... but `Python` still allows you to analyze the data. So most of the time, you can *reduce* and *analyse* your data within the same environment! You may even be able, sometimes, to query them through `Python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still not convinced, please have a look at this Nature paper (Nature 518, 7537) by J.M. Perkel http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20150206  \n",
    "The following quote from this paper summarizes what I have just said before: \n",
    "> \"With the explosive growth of 'big data' in disciplines such as bioinformatics, neuroscience and astronomy, programming know-how is becoming ever more crucial. Researchers who can write code in Python can deftly manage their data sets, and work much more efficiently on a whole host of research-related tasks â€” from crunching numbers to cleaning up, analysing and visualizing data. Whereas some programming languages, such as MATLAB and R, focus on mathematical and statistical operations, Python is a general-purpose language, along the lines of C and C++ (the languages in which much commercial software and operating systems are written). As such, it is perhaps more complicated, Brown says, but also more capable: it is amenable to everything from automating small sets of instructions, to building websites, to fully fledged applications.\""

    "\n",
    "What does this mean? Programming languages are generally categorized into two classes: *compiled* and *interpreted*. `Python` may be considered as an *interpreted* language (although at some level it is *compiled*). One speaks of **compiled** language when a code is executed natively through the operating system after an operation, called *compilation* that converts the original code into a code natively understandable by the machine. *Instead*, when the code is evaluated line by line through another program (which is NOT the OS) which handles its execution (in principle this execution is done in a language natively understood by the machine, also called *low-level* language) via *interpretation*, one speaks of an **interpreted** language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? Although a given language often exists in different flavours/implementations that are either interpreted or compiled, the difference has an impact on the language properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of interpreted languages:\n",
    "1. platform independence (you can easily transport a code from one machine to another\n",
    "2. dynamic typing / flexibility (you do not have to do \"compile/recompile/test/recompile\" all the time !; you can run individual commands without writing a full script.)\n",
    "3. ease of debugging (it is easier to get source code information in interpreted languages)\n",
    "4. small program size (since interpreted languages have flexibility to choose instruction code)\n",
    "5. automatic memory management    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of interpreted languages: \n",
    "1. Speed\n",
    "2. Speed\n",
    "3. Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is effectively a (very) high-level language, which means that there is *a lot* of built-in data-types (and we will spend most of the remaining of this class to go though the most important ones: arrays, dictionaries, lists). This variety of data types is part of the reason why Python became so popular as it can deal easily with many different kind of input/outputs. \n",

    "We have two ways to run Python, either interactively, or from scripts. *Interactive* use is favoured when you want to do small exploratory analysis, test part of codes, visualise some results, while scripts will be used in general to run (and re-run) more complex programs. For now, we will only use *interactive* mode, within `Jupyter Notebooks`. An overview of other ways for using Python is outlined in this [Notebook](Scripts_IDEs_and_Jupyter.ipynb).     "

To produce a float result in Python 2, you can convert one of the numbers to float (`float(x)` or add a `.` after integers to define them as floats (`3` is an integer but `2.` is a float).\n",
    "- Unless `r` or `R` is preceding a string, escape sequences *in strings* are interpreted according to rules similar to standard `C`. The most common escape sequences are `\"\\n\"` (which adds a newline character at the end of the string), `\"\\t\"` (which adds a tab), and `\"\\b\"` (Backspace). Note that typing in an interactive shell `\"Hello \\n\"`, or `print(r\"Hello \\n\")` will not have the same effect. When the `r` or `R` prefix is preceding the string, the backslash is treated as a common letter in the string and not interpreted. See https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html for more details regarding string formatting. (We will come back to the formatted output of strings and numbers later.)"
