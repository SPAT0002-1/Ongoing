    "Is it Yet Another Language ? No, this is, in my opinion, the most important programming language you should masterize before the end of your cursus. In the last (two) decade(s), `Python` became one of the most popular/used language in data science and in particular in astronomy. The reasons for this are rooted in several of the advantages of `Python`:\n",
    "- Readability\n",
    "- Flexibility\n",
    "- High-level language\n",
    "- Robust methods for binding with `C`, `C++` and `FORTRAN` libraries (speed, legacy)\n",
    "- Growing number of libraries (coordinated by a very active community) and modules dedicated to specific scientific problems\n",
    "- You can use basically one single scripting language for every task you may need to do in astronomy. \n",
    "- Data reduction for a growing number of space observatories are running in python. This is the case for ALMA ([CASA](https://casa.nrao.edu/) environment calls C/C++ programs within ipython), JWST (see [data reduction tools](https://jwst.stsci.edu/observing-programs/data-analysis-toolbox) develloped in python), `HST`, `Chandra` (there is `CIAO` modules for python), ... and many others. All the data reduction developped within iraf are available through `pyraf`. The only noticable exception remains `ESO` data reduction tools ... but `python` still allows you to analyze the data. So most of the time, you can *reduce* and *analyse* your data within the same environment ! You may even be able, some times, to query them through `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not yet convinced, I encourage you to have a look to this Nature paper (Nature 518, 7537) by J.M. Perkel http://www.nature.com/news/programming-pick-up-python-1.16833?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20150206  \n",
    "The following quote from this paper summarizes what I have just said before: \n",
    "> \" With the explosive growth of 'big data' in disciplines such as bioinformatics, neuroscience and astronomy, programming know-how is becoming ever more crucial. Researchers who can write code in Python can deftly manage their data sets, and work much more efficiently on a whole host of research-related tasks â€” from crunching numbers to cleaning up, analysing and visualizing data. Whereas some programming languages, such as MATLAB and R, focus on mathematical and statistical operations, Python is a general-purpose language, along the lines of C and C++ (the languages in which much commercial software and operating systems are written). As such, it is perhaps more complicated, Brown says, but also more capable: it is amenable to everything from automating small sets of instructions, to building websites, to fully fledged applications.\""

Guido van Rossum worked at that time in a project called Amoeba, a distributed operating system. He programmed in a language called ABC but was not fully happy with that language. \n",

    "\n",
    "What does it mean? Programming languages are generally categorized in two classes: *compiled* and *interpreted*. `python` may be seen as an *interpreted* language (although at some level it is *compiled*). One speaks of **compiled** language when a code is executed natively through the operating system after an operation, called *compilation* that converts the original code into a code natively understandable by the machine. *Instead*, when the code is evaluated line by line through another program (which is NOT the OS) which handles its execution (in principle this execution is done in a language natively understood by the machine, also called *low-level* language) via *interpretation*, one speaks of an **interpreted** language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important ? Although a given language often exists in different flavours/implementations that are either interpreted or compiled, the difference has an impact on the language properties. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages of interpreted language:\n",
    "1. platform independence (you can easily transport a code from one machine to another\n",
    "2. dynamic typing / flexibility (you do not have to do \"compile/recompile/test/recompile\" all the time !; you can run individual commands without writing a full script.)\n",
    "3. ease of debugging (it is easier to get source code information in interpreted languages)\n",
    "4. small program size (since interpreted languages have flexibility to choose instruction code)\n",
    "5. automatic memory management    \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of interpreted language: \n",
    "1. Speed\n",
    "2. Speed\n",
    "3. Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is effectively a (very) high-level language, which means that there is *a lot* of built-in data-types (and we will spend most of the remaining of this class to go though the most important ones: arrays, dictionnary, lists). This variety of data types is part of the reason why python became so popular as it can deal easily with many different kind of input/outputs. \n",

For now, we will only use *interactive* mode, within `jupyter notebooks`. An overview of other ways for using python is outlined in this [Notebook](Scripts_IDEs_and_Jupyter.ipynb).     "

To get a float, you can convert number into float (float(x) or add a `.` after integers to define them as floats (`3` is an integer but `2.` is a float).\n",
    "- Unless `r` or `R` is preceding a string, escape sequences *in strings* are interpreted according to rules similar to standard `C`. The most common escape sequences are `\"\\n\"` (adds a new line at the end of the string), `\"\\t\"` (adds a tab), `\"\\b\"` (Backspace). Note that typing in an interactive shell `\"Hello \\n\"`, or`print(r\"Hello \\n\")` wont' have the same effect. When `r` or prefix is preceding the string, the backslash is left in the string.
