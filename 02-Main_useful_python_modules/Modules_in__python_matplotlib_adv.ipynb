The values are all in relative units w.r.t. the size of the figure (i.e. 1 is the full width/heigth of the figure).

    "In practice, this can be a lot of work for simple and common things (e.g. setting the tick label properties) to set the plot properties as in III.2.1, so matplotlib allows users to specify default properties via rc parameters. These can be set either in a ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc file, or in a script. To set these via a file, see [matplotlibrc](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/users/customizing.html#a-sample-matplotlibrc-file) (this also shows all the options that are availables). Example (modified) lines from this script include:\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "#xtick.major.size     : 4      # major tick size in points\n",
    "#xtick.minor.size     : 2      # minor tick size in points\n",
    "#xtick.major.pad      : 4      # distance to major tick label in points\n",
    "#xtick.minor.pad      : 4      # distance to the minor tick label in points\n",
    "#xtick.color          : r      # color of the tick labels\n",
    "#xtick.labelsize      : medium # fontsize of the tick labels\n",
    "#xtick.direction      : out     # direction: in or out\n",
    "```\n",
    "These lines are commented out by default, but you can uncomment them to make them active. However, it’s often easier to define properties on a per-script basis using the rc function. This function’s first argument is the category of the settings, and this is followed by a set of keyword arguments to set the parameters for this element. \n",
    "You can also set these parameters directly using:\n",
