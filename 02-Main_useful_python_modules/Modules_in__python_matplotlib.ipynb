    "\n",
    "For now, we have basically only used in-line coding and reading/writing results at screen/in files. This is nice but for an interactive language one would like to be able to visualise/plot results easily, without using other software. Even better, one would like to be able to generate publishing-quality figures. This capability to visualize data/results with a high flexibility and generate the figures you will present in your paper/report/poster is fortunatelly also one of the strengths of `Python` ... People sometimes complain that generating figures that match exactly what you aim at is not always easy ... This is *partly* true. As you'll see below, you can already do a lot with the basic commands you have access with matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is `matplotlib` ?* Matplotlib is a python 2-d plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shell, web application servers, and six graphical user interface toolkits. A good way to see the matplotlib capabilities is to skim through the [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/), and more specifically have a look to the [Thumbnail gallery](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index). See the Section [References](#VI) of this notebook to find more specific links to Matplotlib documentation.\n",

In ipython, and interactive window plotting (in general qt backend) you can also click in the window on the small \"disk\" icon. The interactive window also allows you to modify the size and subplot properties interactively (you can even change the line properties, ...). Although this may look convenient, this is not recommended to create the final version of your figure only that way. Use it maybe to experiment with various presentation and save the parameter results when you are happy such that latter on, you can re-launch your script with exactly the same set of parameters and get exactly the same output.

For scientific publications, \"pdf\" or \"ps\" (postscript) are best. \n",
    "- If you have several curves on your figure, verify that your plot is still readable in black and white. If not, think of using the variety of line styles and/or modify the linewidth and/or modify transparency (alpha) when possible to distinguish the various curves. Note that transparency is not always kept properly after savefig (especially when saving in postscript format). Think also to color blinded people and avoid using \"green\" and \"red\" on the same figure ! You can use color blindness simulator http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/ to check the legibility of your figure !\n",
    "- Are the labels, legend, ticks, large enough. You can modify the size of the labels using \"fontsize\" argument in `set_xlabel` (either \"small/medium/large\" or a float: 16/18 may be good for many application). Modifying the size of the ticks may be a bit more painful (but see below the [rcparameters](#rcparameters)), but remember also this simple way to change the size (but also color, ...) of the tick-labels: \n",
    "``` python\n",
    "ax.tick_params(axis='both', which='major', labelsize=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Beware that a fontsize that looks good on a figure of (10,8), may not on a figure of (18, 14). Especially since those figures may be shrinked in your publication (to occupy 1/2 columns). For that reason do not forget the argument \"`figsize()`\" when defining your figure. \n",
    "- You may feel, after exporting your figure, that there is still a lot of white space on top/left/bottom/up compared to the effective figure size. You can surely change this using the `subplot_adjust()` but there is a cheapper and generally effective way to do it with a single command line:\n",
