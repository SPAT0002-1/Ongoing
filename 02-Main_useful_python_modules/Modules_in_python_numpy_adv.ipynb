    "#### Formatting Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "It often happens that you do not need to save all the decimals of a number, or would like to see it in scientific notation. There are [multiple ways to do it](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html). One could spend (boring) hours describing all possible ways to format strings. The main 2 options are described below. You may look at https://pyformat.info/ to skim through various examples of formatting. The options described below explains you the basics and points yoi to relevant documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1**: `printf-style` (simple (old style) but not universal) \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `%` operator to specify the formatting of the variable you want to show at the screen or save in a file. The variable does not appear explicitly in the string but after it in a tuple, preceded by the `%`. Within the string, the `%` operator will be followed by a format string such as `%f` for a float or `%e` for scientific notation. The sequence `'%.2f'%variable` basically tells that the `%` operator converts the `variable` into a float with 2 digits after the dot. This is generalized to a sequence of variable, by defining the tuple object that contains all the variables to be formatted (but you need to specify the format you want for those, the association between the format and the variable being done easily as you have put your variable into a tuple-object). \n",
    "\n",

    "``` python\n",
    "print('%i is the square of %i' %(4.000, 2))\n",
    "    Out: 4 is the square of 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here are some commonly used formatting characters:\n",
    "- `%s`: String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)\n",
    "- `%d` or `%i`: Integers\n",
    "- `%.<number_of_digits>f`: Floating point numbers with fixed number of digits to the right of the dot. \n",
    "- `%.<number_of_digits>e`: scientific notation with fixed number of digits to the right of the dot.   \n",

    "- **Option 2**: `str.format()` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a much more flexible and general method described in details at https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatstrings. Format strings contain `replacement fields` surrounded by curly braces `{}`. Anything that is not contained in braces is considered literal text, which is *copied unchanged to the output*. If you need to include a brace character in the literal text, it can be escaped by doubling: {{ and }}. The `replacement field` can start with a `field_name` that specifies the object whose value is to be formatted and inserted into the output instead of the replacement field. The field_name is optionally followed by a `conversion field`, which is preceded by an exclamation point '!', and a `format_spec`, which is preceded by a colon `:`. These specify a non-default format for the replacement value. The `conversion field` causes a type coercion before formatting. You can in general ignore it). The `format_spec` is more advanced than in the printf style, allowing for alignement, signing, filling empty spaces, .... See [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language) and [here](https://pyformat.info/) for more details and EXAMPLES. \n",

    "**Note**: There is another very useful way in python to save \"full objects\" and access and use them later using all their characteristics. This can be done by importing the `pickle` [module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pickle.html), or even better (faster) [cPickle]( http://docs.python.org/library/pickle.html#module-cPickle). When you want to write a pickle into a file, simply open your file (`pkl_file = open()`), use `pickle.dump(obj, pkl_file, protocol=-1)`, and close your file (`pkl_file.close()`). To read an object saved in a pickle file, you can follow the same procedure but use `\tobj = pickle.load(pkl_file)` instead of `pickle.dump()`. The `pandas` module also allows you to read/write pickle objects: see `pandas.read_pickle()` and `pandas.to_pickle()`"
