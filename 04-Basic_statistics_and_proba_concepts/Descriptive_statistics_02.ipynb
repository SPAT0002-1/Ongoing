    "There are a lot of distributions and you may sometimes wonder how to choose one to describe your data ... If you keep in mind some examples of phenomena associated with common distributions, you'll more easily identify which distribution is relevant fo your science case. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Bernouilli distribution](#Bernoulli)**: This is the distribution you get when you toss a Coin. In an astrophysical context, this can be whether an object is member of a given class (e.g. star vs galaxy).  \n",
    "* **[Uniform distribution](#Uniform-distribution)**: This is the natural expansion of Bernoulli. Instead of 2 values (0,1), you have an ensemble of values: e.g. you throw a dice (instead of a coin). You can *generalise* to **continuous** uniform distributions. The projected PA of galaxies on the sky generally follow a uniform distribution.  \n",
    "* **[Binomial distribution](#Binomial)**: This is the distribution that results from a binomial, number of heads in a toss coin (e.g. P(3 heads) among x trials). The number of exoplanets detected among a set of n stars. \n",
    "* [Hypergeometric distribution](#Hypergeometric): Cousin of Bernoulli. Finite sample, NO replacement\n",
    "* **[Poisson distribution](#Poisson-distribution)**: related to binomial but low number of success / rare events ! This is the distribution you have when you collect photons with your telescope: many are sent but only a few are collected. This is also when you collect particles resulting from a radioactive decay. \n",
    "* [Geometric distribution](#Geometric-distribution): Related to Bernouilli. How many times do I need to flip a coin to get a success; E.g. Knowing a transit optical depth (i.e. proba. To get a transit when observing a star), what is the probability to get a transit after observing 2 stars. Knowing 1 lens/800 what is P(lens) after 100 QSO ? \n",
    "* **[Gaussian distribution](#Gaussian-or-normal-distribution)**: Many random variable end up being distributed following a gaussian distribution, because of the central limit theorem ... but be careful with abusive interpretation of this theorem (We'll rediscuss the central limit theorem in a future lecture). \n",
    "* **[Chi2 distribution](#chi2)**: this is the distribution followed by the sum of the square of $k$ independent, normally distributed, random variable.\n",
    "* **[Student's distribution](#Student's-distribution)**: distribution that arises when you calculate the mean of a distribution, and an estimator of the std on the mean, when your sample is small. This is important when you want to quote uncertainties with some confidence. "

    "**Example**: This is an important distribution in astronomy because it describes the distribution of the number of photons counted in a given interval. X-ray photons (especially of faint X-ray sources !) strictly follow Poisson distribution. When there are many photons, the distribution becomes close to a gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sqrt{\\mu})$. You can identify the trials to the photons sent (in all directions) but we collect only a few of them. In fact we can say that photons arrive at a rate $\\lambda$ $=>$ If I integrate over a time $t$, I measure $\\mu = \\lambda * t$ photons. The standard deviation is thus $\\sqrt{\\mu} = \\sqrt{\\lambda * t}$. Hence, in a photon limited case you have you Signal to Noise: $ \\frac{S}{N} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} \\propto \\sqrt{t}$. If you want to double your Signal To Noise Ratio (S/N or SNR), you'll need to multiply your exposure time by 4. Instead, if you observe faint objects, you may be limited by the read out noise.\n",
