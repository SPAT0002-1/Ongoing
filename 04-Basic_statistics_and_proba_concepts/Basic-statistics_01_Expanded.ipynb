    "First of all, let's remind us some definitions and notations, so everybody is on the same page. \n",
    "\n",
    "In probability theory, we define the following:\n",
    "- the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is generally called **sample space** and denoted, $\\Omega$. \n",
    "- Points in $\\Omega$, are called **realisations** $\\omega$. \n",
    "- An **Event** is a subset of $\\Omega$ (i.e. a subsample of the $\\omega$).\n",
    "- $p(A)$ is the **probability** of an event A. ($p(A)$ can also refer to a probability that a value of $x$ falls in a d$x$ wide interval around $x$. )\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: We measure the magnitude $m$ of a variable star. Then $\\Omega = {\\rm I\\!R}$ (or some plausible range such as $]-30, 40 [ $, but this makes little difference in practice and $\\Omega$ can in general be larger than needed). $\\omega$ is a value in $\\Omega$. While an event is the ensemble of magnitude measurements that are e.g. such that $m_i > 15$ and $m_i <=15.5$, hence this *event* is A = ]15, 15.5]. Note that an event *can* also be a single point (i.e. A = [17.]). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are confortable with your understanding of basic probability concepts, you can go directly to [Sect. I.3](#I.3-What-is-a-random-variable-?). Otherwise, the next sections are there to refresh your mind. \n",

    "### I.1 Probability axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "To qualify as a probability, $p(A)$ must satisfy the three following axioms (also called [Kolmogorov](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andre%C3%AF_Kolmogorov) axioms).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $p(A) > 0$ for each A. \n",
    "2. $p(\\Omega) = 1$\n",

    "p\\left(\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\infty} {A_i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} p(A_i), \n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\cup$ stands for **union**. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence of these axioms, several useful rules can be derived. \n",

    "#### The *sum rule*:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "p(A \\cup B) = p(A) + p(B)-p(A \\cap B)\n",

    "### I.3 What is a random variable ?\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistical inference, we are dealing with *data*. How do we link *sample space* and *events* to data ? The link is the concept of of *random* (or *stochastic*) variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition: \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a random variable is a *mapping* \n",
    "$$\n",
    "X: \\Omega \\to {\\rm I\\!R}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that assigns a real number $X(\\omega_i)~$ to each outcome $\\omega$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A less formal definition is simply that a random variable is a variable whose value results from the measurement of a quantity that is subject to random variations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** You roll a dice. You can then define $X(\\omega)$ be the *number of times you draw an even number* in a sequence $\\omega$. Imagine you have rolled your dice 10 times, and get  $\\omega = {1, {\\bf 2, 4, 2}, 5, {\\bf 4, 6}, 3, 3, 1 }$. Then $X(\\omega) = 5$ is the value taken by your *random variable* X. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can have either *continuous* or *discrete* random variables. If they form a countable set, they are discrete. They are continuous otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning**, a random variable is *NOT* like typical mathematical variables as it can take *different values* (each with an associated probability). In litterature, you will generaly find random variables written with *CAPITAL* letters, and their particular *realization* with *lowercase*. A realisation of a random variable is also called \"random variate\". \n",

    "**Random variable with numpy**\n",
    "\n",
    "In numpy there is a sub-module called random that contains many functions that involve random selection. In particular there is a function `choice` that allows you to make a choice at random. It picks one item at random from an array, and it is equally likely to pick any of the items. The function call is `np.random.choice(array_name)`, where `array_name` is the name of the array from which to make the choice."

    "Let's first define a function that is such that $H_X(x_0)$ expresses the probability for a random variable $x < x_0$. We would have, by definition, $H_X(-\\infty) = 0$ and $H_X(+\\infty) = 1$.   \n",
    "We can then define the **probability density function** (aka **pdf**) $h_X(x)$ as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the **probability density function** (aka **pdf**) $h_X(x)$ is a function that quantifies the probability that the value of a random variable $X$ falls between $x$ and $x+{\\rm d}x$. That probability equals to $h_X(x)\\,{\\rm d}x$. The term *probability distribution* or *differential distribution function* is also used (especially by astronomers ...).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can generalize to multiple variables. The probability for $x < x_0$, and $y < y_0$ is $H(x_0, y_0)$ and the associated pdf is $h(x_0, y_0)\\, {\\rm d}x \\, {\\rm d}y$. The two random variables are independant if $h(x, y) = f(x)~g(y)$ for all values of $x$ and $y$. Note that when two independent random variable are *independently* drawn from the same distribution (i.e.  $h(x, y) = f(x)~f(y)$), one speaks of **independent identically distributed** (iid) random variables. In this case, we obviously have $p(x, y)\\,=\\,p(x)~p(y)$\n"

    "#### Relevance of pdf for statistical inference:\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability density function is at the heart of data mining, and data analysis in general. A key question is indeed to figure out what is the pdf $h_X(x)$ that is behind a set of random variables (directly observed or predicted by a model fed by some data). I.e. we generally try to answer the question \"From which pdf $h(x)$ are drawn my $x$ ?\". In Bayesian inference, one tries to derive the (posterior) pdf associated to a quantity. Why are we interested by those ? Because they tell us something about the probability of an event/observation to occur or help us to figure out whether a physical model is sensible *given* the observations in hands.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the convention of our [reference book](#book), we use $h(x)$ when we refer to the *true* pdf (or **population** pdf), and $f(x)$ when we refer to its *data* derived estimate (**empirical** pdf). Since $x$ are generally measured with errors, it may be that $f(x)$ does not tend to $h(x)$ even for an infinite number of measurements (we end up with a \"blurred\" or \"broadened\" version of the pdf). Because $h(x)$ gives the probability that $x$ falls in an (infinitely) small interval $x, x+{\\rm{d}}x$, the pdf is also sometimes written $p(x)$ (cf Chapter 3 of our [reference book](#book)). \n",
    "\n",
    "As we said, $f(x)$ is a *model* of the *true* distribution $h(x)$. We observe data points that are *samples* of the true distribution $h(x)$. In general, we do not know $h(x)$ and we have to guess its functional form. This function form can either be \"parametric\" (e.g. a gaussian) or \"non parametric\" (e.g. a sum of small gaussians that mimic a more complex pdf). "

If $x_1 < x_2$, then $P(x_1 < X < x_2) = H(x_2) - H(x_1)$. On the above figure, this would be the difference of area up to $x_2$ minus the area up to $x_1$.   \n",

    "We have reviewed basic statistical concepts and quantities, and how to use them in python. In particular: \n",

    "- the probability combination rules. \n",
    "- what is a**random variable** (this is a key concept!), and how to generate and manipulate random variable with numpy: `np.random.rand()`, `np.random.seed(value)`, `np.random.randint()`, `np.random.permutation()`\n",
    "- Probability density function (pdf) and Cumulative density function (CDF) (You *need* to understand what are these functions very well !)\n",
    "- How to manipulate distributions with `scipy.stats`. For example, to work with a gaussian, and subsequently calculate pdf, cdf, ... drawn from a gaussian distribution, : `g = scipy.stats.norm()` followed by `g.pdf(x)` to get a pdf sampled for values x (single value or array), `g.cdf(x)` for the cdf(), ...\n",
    "- How to calculate an interquartile range based on the cdf of a function, using the inverse of a cdf, the ppf of percent point function (`scipy.stats.mydistribution.ppf()`). \n",
    "- Use `scipy.special()` to calculate special function, in particular `scipy.special.erf()` which is the Gauss error function.  "
